# iOS-DogBreedClassifier

This is a project to practice SwiftUI and CoreML (both under Swift), which are two great features delivered among iOS development world. I have very little App development experience, so I am also interested how much I can do. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).

TODO:

1. Randomly select 20% training data as testing data. It will be used for challenging human and AI model
2. Add a feature to randomly select one image to show from testing data
3. Randomly generates four options to choose the shown dog image's breed, one of each should be correct
4. Enhance the performance of the model
