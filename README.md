# iOS-DogBreedClassifier

This is a project to practice SwiftUI and CoreML (both under Swift), which are two great features delivered among iOS development world. I have very little App development experience, so I am also interested how much I can do. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).

TODO:

1. Randomly show an image along with four choices for users to choose
   1. ~~Implement UI with one image and four choice~~
   2. ~~Import testing images and implement selecting an image randomly~~
   3. ~~Generate four choices randomly and show correctly on the UI~~
2. Implement classification model's prediction on randomly shown image
3. Replace one of four choices with model's prediction
4. Randomly select 20% training data as testing data. It will be used for challenging human and AI model
5. Implement battle between AI and human
6. Track the records
7. Enhance the performance of the model
